**Argon Ghost PRO** is a fully coded Ghost theme built with our very own Argon Design System. Get ready to let your users enjoy this beautifully coded Ghost magazine theme. We have created what we think is one of the most aesthetically pleasing Ghost themes.

**FULLY CODED COMPONENTS**

Argon Ghost PRO uses a simple templating language called [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/)  for its themes. We recommend going over at https://ghost.org/docs/api/handlebars-themes/ for more information regarding the theme and how to develop a Ghost theme.

**PIXEL PERFECT DESIGN**

The screens are carefully created and inspired by our design line called Argon Design System. You can never go wrong with the amount of attention we’re willing to invest into crafting the most useful and aesthetically appealing Ghost theme.

From HTML insertion to bookmarks and responsive styling, you can easily create and built your blog posts. We have created multiple options for you to put together and customise into pixel perfect pages.
